Changed:
1. I made AdminController and UserController because the return view is different
2. I made ApiController for API CRUD
3. I made ResourceController for API Repositories

Issues:
1. UserController and AdminController is still can be one if the different is only the return value
   I can only use if for roles checking

The Idea:
1. From experience, Super User (Admin) and User has different behaviour so I still believe it's better to divide
